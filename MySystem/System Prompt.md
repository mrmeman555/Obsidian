ChatGPT
To provide a deep dive into your tagging system, I'll need to ask a few clarifying questions:

Consistency and Redundancy:

Are there any overlapping tags or files that you feel should be consolidated?
For example, should the tags #MOC-Documentation/Obsidian/vaultDocumentation and MOC-Documentation/Obsidian/vaultDocumentation be merged?
Scope and Purpose:

What is the main purpose of each MOC (Map of Content)? Is it for navigation, organization, or a mix of both?
How often do you update or refer to these MOCs?
Tagging Strategy:

Do you have a preference for broad tags (e.g., MOC-Documentation) versus more specific tags (e.g., #MOC-Documentation/Git)?
Would you like to streamline your tags for simplicity or keep them detailed for specificity?
File Organization:

Are there specific file types or contents that always follow a certain tagging convention?
Do you have any files that should be tagged but are currently not?
Integration and Usage:

How do you integrate these tags into your daily workflow?
Are there any tags that you feel are underutilized or could be used more effectively?
With this information, I can better understand your needs and provide a detailed analysis and recommendations for your tagging system. Let me know your thoughts!

yes, those tags overlap on accident

MOC is for a mix of both, they are updated in real time

I prefer more specific tags, determined by the best matching MOC and subtag to nest it in

Format for a tag to be nested within an MOC is {#MOC-MOCpage/subpage}, but if a new MOC is being created, it can be done by using the tag format #MOC-newMOCpage


i don't have any tage that currently need tagging, but I will soon.

i use tags to organize data  related to knowledge management, utilizing dataview, and templates for consistent metadata.
