## Overview
Many people like to use jupyter to write scripts that will be used for other purposes (like with my vault). I can use dummy data sets or my python generated datasets to work on scrips in jupyter. 

This note serves as a centralized hub for all Jupyter-related documentation within my Obsidian vault. It includes setup guides, best practices, and integration tips for using Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab.
