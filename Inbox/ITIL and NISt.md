## ITIL and NIST
IT Infrastructure Library and National Institute of Standards and Technology

My entire job with USAA was to make sure internal contracts were followed, and work completed was satisfactory. I had to justify why work completed was sufficient, and point out where it could be better.

**Issue Validation:**
- I ensured efforts to become compliant were in alignment with internal contracts.

- "I have successfully developed and implemented compliance systems based on ITIL and NIST guidelines in my previous roles. At Endeavors, I can leverage this experience to create robust compliance frameworks that ensure all IT operations are in line with contractual and regulatory requirements. This will not only improve overall compliance but also provide a structured approach to managing and monitoring IT services."

I did audits for our disaster relief and recovery procedures at USAA. My main purpose was to ensure that processes were in place (created by departments after getting instructions from upper management) were appropriate for what they were instructed to create.



### High-Level Overview of NIST and ITIL

#### NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)

- **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity, offering standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risk.
- **Core Components:**
  - **Identify:** Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risks.
  - **Protect:** Implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical infrastructure services.
  - **Detect:** Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
  - **Respond:** Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.
  - **Recover:** Maintain plans for resilience and restore any capabilities or services impaired due to a cybersecurity event.

#### ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)

- **Purpose:** Offers a set of detailed practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of the business. It aims to deliver high-quality IT services that meet business needs.
- **Core Components:**
  - **Service Strategy:** Define the perspective, position, plans, and patterns that a service provider needs to execute to meet an organization's business outcomes.
  - **Service Design:** Create IT policies, architectures, and documents to meet current and future business needs.
  - **Service Transition:** Develop and improve capabilities for transitioning new and changed services into operations.
  - **Service Operation:** Ensure that IT services are delivered effectively and efficiently, including fulfilling user requests, resolving service failures, fixing problems, and carrying out routine operational tasks.
  - **Continual Service Improvement:** Continuously align and realign IT services to changing business needs by identifying and implementing improvements to IT services that support business processes.

### Application to the IT Operations Position at Endeavors

#### Ensuring Service Delivery and Compliance

- **ITIL:**
  - **Service Operation:** Implement structured processes for incident management, request fulfillment, and problem management to ensure services are delivered efficiently and effectively.
  - **Service Transition:** Develop and refine processes for introducing new services and changes to existing services, ensuring minimal disruption and a smooth transition.
  
- **NIST:**
  - **Protect:** Implement safeguards and security measures to protect IT infrastructure and sensitive data, ensuring service delivery complies with cybersecurity standards.
  - **Respond:** Develop response strategies for cybersecurity incidents, minimizing impact on service delivery.

#### Developing and Implementing Compliance Systems

- **ITIL:**
  - **Service Strategy and Service Design:** Establish policies and procedures that ensure IT services align with business objectives and comply with contractual requirements.
  - **Continual Service Improvement:** Regularly review and improve compliance processes and systems to adapt to new challenges and regulatory changes.

- **NIST:**
  - **Identify:** Develop a thorough understanding of compliance requirements and risks, ensuring that compliance systems are comprehensive and up-to-date.
  - **Recover:** Maintain recovery plans to ensure business continuity and compliance in the event of a security breach or system failure.

#### Training and Auditing

- **ITIL:**
  - **Service Design:** Create training programs to educate IT staff on compliance policies, service management practices, and operational procedures.
  - **Continual Service Improvement:** Regularly audit IT services and processes, identifying areas for improvement and ensuring adherence to established standards.

- **NIST:**
  - **Detect:** Implement monitoring and auditing tools to identify compliance issues and security vulnerabilities.
  - **Protect:** Ensure that all team members are trained on cybersecurity best practices and compliance requirements.

#### Process Improvement and Quality Assurance

- **ITIL:**
  - **Continual Service Improvement:** Lead initiatives to evaluate and improve IT processes, enhancing service quality and operational efficiency.
  - **Service Operation:** Implement quality assurance measures to maintain high standards of service delivery.

- **NIST:**
  - **Identify and Protect:** Use NIST guidelines to identify process weaknesses and implement measures to protect against potential security threats.

#### Reporting and Metrics

- **ITIL:**
  - **Service Operation and Continual Service Improvement:** Develop key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting tools to track service performance, compliance, and quality.
  - **Service Transition:** Ensure that metrics and reporting systems are in place for new services and changes to existing services.

- **NIST:**
  - **Respond and Recover:** Use NIST frameworks to develop metrics for monitoring cybersecurity incidents and recovery efforts, ensuring transparency and continuous improvement.

By applying these frameworks, you can ensure that Endeavors' IT operations are efficient, compliant, and secure, ultimately supporting the organization's mission and service delivery across its various programs.
