# Daily Note - 2024-05-29

# Quote of the day
1. **‚ÄúFocus on progress, not perfection.‚Äù**

## Keep In Mindüí≠
Study protocols, not just osi layers. this will help you break through and keep progress. 

Do Flashcards at least 20 minutes every day. critical study plan. 

I think i may be experiencing a lot of resistance because I'm expecting it. Also, possibly because I'm doing the new thing of using this new obsidian setup. I think i often mistake being in a learning curve with something being wrong with me.
