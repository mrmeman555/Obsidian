## Attendees
- Jordan Leuck
- Clay

## Agenda
- Interview for Resolution Consultant role at Asset Works
- Discuss job role and company information

## Notes
### Summary
I think this interview went well; he said to expect to hear back from them.

This meeting is related to my [[MOCs/Job Search MOC|Job Search MOC]] and my Asset Works application for the 'Resolution Consultant' role at Asset Works. It's at 10 AM on 5/28/24. Attendees are Jordan Leuck and Clay (help desk manager).

### Key Points
- **Interviewer Details**:
  - Clay is basically the help desk manager.
  - He is a D&D nerd.

- **Company Information**:
  - Multi-divisional; the customer care role is for the division facility.
  - They provide IWMS software solutions for higher education organizations (universities and colleges).
  - Facilities departments use this software as a one-stop shop database.
  - Software includes AIM, READY, GO: database, frontend web app, iOS mobile platform.
  - GO is used by their techs.

- **Job Role**:
  - Front-end support, first level triage.
  - Lots of proprietary knowledge required.
  - First line solves any problems they can.
  - Utilizes other departments to collaborate rather than having an internal escalation chain.
  - Tickets stay in your queue even if transferred to other departments.

- **Preparation**:
  - See if I have reference material from past interviews with this company for today.
  - Prep a little.

### Additional Information
- Customer resource center documents breaking changes (what's new per release).
- They use Jira for known issues.
- Clarified what a 'hot fix' is.

### Challenges
- Very 'green team'; they just filled three positions within the last month.
- No clear answer on how they handle KPIs; graded on ticket closures and responsiveness.
- Takes a long time to establish a baseline knowledge for the software.
- Remote work on Mon, Wed, Fri; in-office 2 days a week.
- Always conduct a second, panel-based interview with other team leads across other departments.

### Discussions
- **Salary**: 55-65k; I indicated a preference for 60k.
- I'll be hearing from Jordan near the end of this week if not early next week.
- The second interview isn't knowledge-based questions; it's more about learning more about my technical background.

## Action Items
- Await a response from Jordan for scheduling the second interview.
- Prepare questions and review notes on technical background and previous experience.
