# Use aliases in git
**Aliases**Â in Git allow you to create shorthand commands for common operations. Instead of typing out lengthy Git commands, you can define custom aliases that make your workflow more efficient. These aliases are like shortcuts, making it easier to remember and execute Git tasks.

Hereâ€™s what each of the aliases youâ€™ve provided does:

1. **`alias.st`**Â (Status):
    
    - This alias simplifies theÂ `git status`Â command.
    - When you typeÂ `git st`, Git will display the status of your working directory (untracked files, modified files, etc.).
2. **`alias.co`**Â (Checkout):
    
    - TheÂ `git checkout`Â command is used to switch branches or restore files from a specific commit.
    - With this alias, you can useÂ `git co`Â instead ofÂ `git checkout`.
3. **`alias.br`**Â (Branch):
    
    - TheÂ `git branch`Â command lists existing branches or creates new ones.
    - The alias allows you to useÂ `git br`Â instead ofÂ `git branch`.

Setting up these aliases globally (usingÂ `--global`) means theyâ€™ll be available across all your Git repositories. You can customize them further by adding more aliases or modifying existing ones.

Remember, aliases enhance productivity and streamline your Git experience. Feel free to create additional aliases for other frequently used commands!
