# Core Belief about the Nature of Work

I believe that I can't enjoy it or be good at it without stimulants. I think that's the only thing that ever cleared my mind up on demand when I didn't have any idea how to regulate my emotions. My brain associates it with pleasure in work and focus in times I'm not feeling it. Maybe changing the belief that I can't focus, that I can't do it, is what's needed. Maybe the work can be naturally reinforcing.

# Mantras

### Self-Compassion Mantras

1. **“I am doing my best, and that is enough.”**
2. **“It’s okay to feel how I’m feeling. This too shall pass.”**
3. **“I am worthy of kindness and compassion.”**
4. **“I treat myself with the same kindness I would offer a friend.”**
5. **“May I be kind to myself in this moment.”**

### Mindfulness and ACT Mantras

1. **“I accept my thoughts and feelings without judgment.”**
2. **“I commit to my values, even in the face of discomfort.”**
3. **“I am present in this moment, just as it is.”**
4. **“I am more than my thoughts and feelings.”**

2. **“May I accept myself as I am.”**
3. **“May I find peace and joy in the present moment.”**
4. **“May I be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.”**
5. **“May I be filled with loving-kindness towards myself and others.”**

### Grounding and Trauma-Informed Mantras

1. **“I am safe in this moment.”**
2. **“I am connected to my body and the present moment.”**

4. **“I focus on progress, not perfection.”**
5. **“I can do hard things, one step at a time.”**

# Ritalin Hurting My Confidence

Only studying when I feel the effects of Ritalin reinforces the belief that I have to abuse it, that I'm not capable without it.

# Good Baseline Emotional Indicator with Ritalin

How I feel in the morning. I can tell I'm feeling more 'blah' in the mornings.

I feel more emotionally fueled in a sense since taking more Adderall. I could see how I could slowly degrade doing this. It's very slight. But I notice a trend in my emotions. If I start doing bad, you know why.

## Feelings of Vulnerability

Remember, many of the hypervigilance you experience stems around a feeling of being scared/flawed, transparent, and vulnerable. The vulnerability is what the actual flight or fight is based around.

## Values-Based Actions and Motivation

Exposure therapy for values-based actions counteracts avoidance tendencies. Emotions are a lagged effect; when I feel any 'suboptimal' way, evaluating my needs and acting accordingly is critical. During the workday, flexibly prioritizing and acting accordingly will make me feel more in control over time. This will feel weird and not worth it, but will yield effects in my life.

# Learning Was Traumatic

Exposure therapy is the answer. Over lots of time of avoidance, I've drawn lots of conclusions about my abilities (false).
