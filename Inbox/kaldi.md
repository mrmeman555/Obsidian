[[supposedly google text to speech would be better for realtime]] 

Kaldi is an exceptionally powerful tool for speech recognition and diarization, but it is not designed for real-time processing out of the box. It is typically used for batch processing, where audio files are fully processed after they have been recorded. However, setting up Kaldi for real-time transcription and diarization can be done, though it requires significant customization and technical expertise.

For real-time transcription and diarization, you might consider other tools that are specifically designed for real-time processing. Here are some alternatives:

### Implementing Real-Time Transcription and Diarization

Here’s a high-level overview of how you can implement real-time transcription and diarization using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text:

1. **Set Up Google Cloud Account:**
    
    - Create a Google Cloud account and enable the Speech-to-Text API.
2. **Install Google Cloud SDK:**
    
    - Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine.
    - Authenticate your Google Cloud account using the SDK.
3. **Stream Audio to the API:**
    
    - Use a programming language like Python to stream audio data to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API in real time.
    - Here's a basic example using Python:
    
    python
    
    Copy
    
    ```
    from google.cloud import speech
    import pyaudio
    import threading
    
    def callback(response):
        for result in response.results:
            print('Transcript: {}'.format(result.alternatives[0].transcript))
            if result.is_final:
                print('Finalized result')
    
    def listen_print_loop(responses):
        for response in responses:
            if not response.results:
                continue
            result = response.results[0]
            if not result.alternatives:
                continue
            transcript = result.alternatives[0].transcript
            print('Transcript: {}'.format(transcript))
    
    client = speech.SpeechClient()
    config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
        encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
        sample_rate_hertz=16000,
        language_code='en-US',
        enable_speaker_diarization=True,
        diarization_speaker_count=2
    )
    
    streaming_config = speech.StreamingRecognitionConfig(
        config=config,
        interim_results=True
    )
    
    def stream_audio():
        with pyaudio.PyAudio() as p:
            stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16,
                            channels=1,
                            rate=16000,
                            input=True,
                            frames_per_buffer=1024)
            audio_generator = (stream.read(1024) for _ in range(0, int(16000 / 1024 * 60)))
            requests = (speech.StreamingRecognizeRequest(audio_content=content) for content in audio_generator)
            responses = client.streaming_recognize(streaming_config, requests)
            listen_print_loop(responses)
    
    threading.Thread(target=stream_audio).start()
    ```
    
4. **Read Transcripts in Real Time:**
    
    - The script above streams audio from your microphone, sends it to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, and prints the transcripts in real time.
