### Technical Recommendations and Considerations for The Hybrid Approach

#### **Security Monitoring and Incident Response:**

**Initial Setup by Friend:**

- **System and Security Protocols:** Use enterprise-grade firewall solutions (e.g., Cisco ASA, Fortinet) with Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).
	- q considering i'll be switching to an isp, should i just use defender at first and then let them use their own firewall, or can they use mine?
- **Endpoint Security:** Deploy antivirus and anti-malware software (e.g., Symantec, McAfee) on all devices.
	-  q again, could i use windows defender to sufficient effect? could an isp continue using windows defender for me?
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Set up a SIEM system (e.g., Splunk, LogRhythm) to aggregate and correlate security logs. (considering we don't neet to track that much internally and don't want to spend money on a ticketing system, make recommendations.)
- **VPN:** Configure a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for secure remote access (e.g., OpenVPN).
	- q make recommendations considering the system will be eventually passed off to the isp. 
**Outsourced ISP Monitoring & Response:**

- **24/7 Monitoring:** Leverage the ISP's Network Operations Center (NOC) for continuous threat detection and response.
- **Security Dashboards:** Ensure the ISP provides access to real-time security dashboards for oversight. 
	- q is this a common thing offered?
- **Considerations:** Verify the ISP's incident response times and their process for escalating critical issues.
	- q how could we do this cheaply?

#### **Disaster Recovery Planning and Execution:**

**Outsource:**

- **Automated Backups:** Implement cloud-based backup solutions (e.g., Veeam, Acronis) for automated regular backups.
- **Testing:** Schedule regular disaster recovery drills to test the integrity and speed of the recovery process.
- **Considerations:** Ensure the recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) meet business requirements.

#### **Network Management and Troubleshooting:**

**Initial Setup by Friend:**

- **Network Configuration:** Use robust routers and switches (e.g., Cisco, HP) and configure VLANs for network segmentation.
	- how can we do this simply and securely, make recommendation of popular methodology in similar situations
- **Wi-Fi:** Set up secure Wi-Fi networks with WPA3 encryption.
- **Documentation:** <font color="#b7dde8">Create detailed network documentation including IP addressing schemes, device configurations, and topology maps.</font>

**Ongoing Troubleshooting by ISP:**

- **Remote Monitoring:** Ensure the ISP provides proactive network monitoring and automated alerts for issues.
- **Communication:** Establish clear protocols for how and when the ISP should report issues to your friend.

#### **Software Updates and Patching:**

**Outsource to ISP:**

- **Patch Management Solutions:** Utilize comprehensive patch management solutions (e.g., SolarWinds, ManageEngine) to automate updates.
- **Custom Setup:** Have your friend determine and set up initial configurations for the software stack based on specific business needs. 
	-q make recommendations of stacks used by dr's offices. 

#### **Server Maintenance and Optimization:**

**Initial Configuration:**

- **Server Solutions:** Use reliable server hardware (e.g., Dell PowerEdge, HP ProLiant) and initial OS setup (e.g., Windows Server, Linux).
- **Virtualization:** Consider virtualization solutions (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V) to optimize server utilization.
	- q discuss what this would entail for a dr's office

**Ongoing Maintenance by ISP:**

- **Proactive Monitoring:** Ensure the ISP provides server monitoring tools and regular performance reports.
- **Remote Access:** Maintain secure remote access for your friend to perform periodic reviews and ad-hoc optimizations.

#### **Maintaining Control In-House:**

**User Account Management:**

- **Active Directory (AD):** Utilize AD for centralized user management and single sign-on (SSO).
- **Group Policies:** Create and enforce Group Policies for user permissions and security settings.

**Basic Hardware Support:**

- **Printer and Laptop Troubleshooting:** Equip in-house staff with basic training and troubleshooting guides.
- **Documentation:** Have your friend document common issues and troubleshooting steps.

**Software Licensing and Procurement:**

- **License Management:** Use software asset management tools (e.g., Flexera, Spiceworks) to track licenses and compliance.

#### **Communication Channels:**

**Using Outlook:**

- **Help Desk System:** Implement a help desk system (e.g., Jira Service Desk, Zendesk) integrated with Outlook for ticketing and tracking.
- **Shared Calendars:** Use shared Outlook calendars to schedule maintenance windows and training sessions.

#### **Choosing the Right Hybrid Model:**

**Assessment:**

- **IT Audit:** Perform a detailed IT audit to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
- **Redundancy:** Plan for hardware redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical systems (e.g., RAID configurations, dual power supplies).

**Budget and Priorities:**

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Evaluate the costs and benefits of each outsourced task to ensure alignment with business goals.
- **Long-Term Scalability:** Consider future growth and the ability to scale services as user count increases.

### **Examples of Hybrid Models:**

1. **MSP for Security and Monitoring:**
    
    - Keep user account setups and AD management in-house.
    - Utilize an MSP for continuous security and network monitoring.
2. **Remote Support for Troubleshooting:**
    
    - Internal staff handles printer setups and basic troubleshooting.
    - Use remote support for complex or infrequent technical issues.
3. **Cloud Services for Storage and Applications:**
    
    - Data Storage: Use Microsoft OneDrive for Business or Google Drive for cloud storage.
    - Applications: Office 365 for email and productivity tools.
    - Manage local network and servers internally with initial configurations overseen by your friend.

By blending in-house control with selective outsourcing, you can optimize IT operations, maintain robust security, and ensure business continuity tailored to your doctor's office's needs.
