## Description
This note outlines strategies and tips for effective flashcard study, particularly for IT interview preparation. The focus is on maximizing the benefit of flashcards for understanding and retaining key concepts.

## Strategies

### 1. Assess Benefit for Interviewing
- **Think about how likely each concept is to be beneficial in an interview.**
- This will help determine where to dive deeper and where to keep it more surface level.

### 2. Prioritize Flashcard Exposures
- **Do flashcard exposures before other tasks.**
- Prioritizing flashcards will significantly enhance retention and understanding.

### 3. Simplify Explanations
- **Learn to explain concepts in ten words or less.**
- Once a high-level idea is understood, add details to each point.
- This method supports building a high-level frame of reference, akin to reverse scaffolded learning.

### 4. Detailed Understanding
- **After grasping the high-level overview, go sentence by sentence to make sense of it.**
- This approach ensures a deeper and more thorough understanding of each topic.

### 5. Daily Flashcard Practice
- **Use [[Daily Flashcards]] and [[Daily Flashcards Prompt]] to study flashcards daily.**
- Regular practice ensures concepts are fresh and easily recalled.

### 6. Focus Areas
- **Concentrate on IT fundamentals (e.g., OSI model) and practical applications in help desk situations.**
- Most IT work involves 'routing and switching,' so use [[an overview of learning IT from this perspective]].

### 7. IT Study Goals
- **Refer to [[IT content study guide, network section of OSI model]] for overall IT study goals.**

### 8. Verbal Practice
- **Do flashcards OUT LOUD.**
- Speaking the answers helps reinforce memory and understanding.

### 9. Utilize Prompts
- **Develop and use [[Prompts Tag Page]].**

### 10. Focus on Protocols
- **Study protocols rather than layers.**
- This approach provides a more practical understanding of network operations.

### 11. Daily Flashcards Page
- **Copy and paste flashcards into a 'flashcards for today' page, query them, and use this page daily.**
- This method simplifies daily practice and ensures consistent study habits.
